        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>My journey towards creating SkilWise began with a personal challenge. I’ve always been a quick learner and have gained hands-on experience in a variety of skills, mostly from home projects and self-study. The problem? I didn’t have any formal education or professional experience to back them up on my resume. Despite being highly skilled, employers would often overlook my abilities simply because I didn’t have a traditional job history to prove it. Even though I felt I was at the top of my game, after learning and mastering several skills, I would face rejection after rejection, with the feedback always pointing to one thing: lack of experience.</p>
        <p>It became clear to me that, in today’s job market, experience often outweighs talent and skills. Employers prefer candidates with a professional background because they believe those individuals are better prepared for the job. As a result, I was frequently told I wasn’t a good fit because my experience didn’t match the traditional requirements.</p>
        <p>That’s when the idea for SkilWise was born. I wanted to create a platform where job seekers like myself could showcase real, verifiable skills—not just the formal titles or experiences that most employers rely on. I wanted to give both job seekers and employers a chance to connect over skills rather than just a resume, to give those with hands-on experience an opportunity to shine.</p>
        <p>I believe skills should speak louder than experience, and with SkilWise, that’s exactly what we’re aiming to do. This platform is designed to empower talented individuals who may not have a traditional resume but have the right skills to succeed.</p>
        <p>Join me as we change the hiring landscape, one skill at a time.</p>
